NGRX\n\n\n\n  NOTICE: Typescript 2.5.3 until peer dependecies of required packages update to ^2.6.x\nMission\n\nThe mission of this project is to provide a simple to use quick start seed that works with @angular/cli. This is to keep this seed's build and development process easy to maintain and build on.\nEmbracing @angular/cli and @ngrx/platform to it's fullest, including @ngrx/schematics for the CLI. @ngrx/schematics is not released yet, but we will keep up with the nightly builds as it progresses towards release as some of its features make developing in the platform extremly efficient.\nThis seed takes a low impact approach to some of the issues plagued by angular electron seeds. This seed uses tried and true packages such as browserlink to instead proxy the electron window, instead of reloading through services such as electron-connect. The electron process is monitored with nodemon to restart its process on changes during live-reload, and HMR development workflow.\nAll building and serving is still done by the CLI. We just proxy the connection to the CLI services via Gulp tasks. All STDOUT output from the CLI during tasks is passed through the wrapping Gulp Task to your process so you can still see it working in the background.\nWe will make an unrelenting effort to keep this seed up to date. We use it internally for own projects and thus keeping everything upto date is paramount. This seed will stay paralell with our own private servers on the 'master' branch.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nElectron Angular NGRX\nMission\nTable of Contents\nGetting Started\nProject Structure\nBuild Process\nBuild - HMR (development)\nBuild - Live Reload (development)\nBuild - One-Shot Launch (development)\nTasks\n\n\nContributing\nToDo\nangular/cli\nRunning unit tests\nRunning end-to-end tests\nFurther help\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nThis project requires Electron, Gulp, and Angular CLI.\nSee angular/cli for CLI version. \n\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\nnpm install -g electron\nnpm install -g gulp@next\nnpm installnpm start is the default task that launchs the HMR development workflow.\nProject Structure\n├── dist                Build Process\nBuild - HMR (development)\nRun npm start (default script) or gulp hmr to build,  and launch the HMR Workflow. \nBuild - Live Reload (development)\nRun npm run live-reload or gulp live-reload to build, launch and proxy live reloads. \nThe angular build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nThe electron build artifacts will be stored in the dist/electron directory.\nThe Electron main process will be restarted automatically if the electron code changes.\nThe Render Process will utilize live reloads to reload changes on save for angular code.\nBuild - One-Shot Launch (development)\nRun npm run launch or gulp electron:launch to build,  and launch non-proxyed static build. \nThe angular build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nThe electron build artifacts will be stored in the dist/electron directory.\nTasks\n ├── build:electron      : Compiles Electron code to 'dist/electron'.\n ├── build:app           : Builds the Angular code via CLI.\n ├── launch:var          : Sets Environment Variable for relative proxy in Electron main window.\n ├── launch:electron     : Launches Electron and pipes STDOUT from main process.\n ├── rebuild:app         : Rebuilds the angular app output to 'dist' directory\n ├── serve:live-reload   : Serves Electron via nodemon and proxy browser-sync.\n ├── live-reload:var     : Sets Environment Variable for relative proxy in Electron main window.\n ├── hmr:var             : Sets Environment Variable for relative proxy in Electron main window.\n ├── serve:hmr           : Spins up the CLI HMR service\n ├── serve:electron-hmr  : Serves Electron via nodemon and proxy CLI HMR service.\n ├── start:docs          : Generates Compodoc documentation and serves it up.\n ├── watch:electron\n ├── watch:app\n ├─┬ live-reload\n │ └─┬ \n │   ├── build:app\n │   ├── build:electron\n │   ├── live-reload:var\n │   └─┬ \n │     ├── watch:electron\n │     ├── watch:app\n │     └── serve:live-reload\n ├─┬ hmr\n │ └─┬ \n │   ├── build:electron\n │   ├── hmr:var\n │   └─┬ \n │     ├── serve:hmr\n │     └── watch:electron\n └─┬ default\n   └─┬ \n     ├── build:app\n     ├── build:electron\n     ├── launch:var\n     └── launch:electronContributing\nPleaes review the CONTRIBUTING guidlines.\nToDo\n\n[x] Integrate HMR (Hot Module Relplacement) workflow.\n[x] Clean up tasks in a uniform manner and self-documenting.\n[x] Integrate simple NGRX with HMR.\n[ ] Electron packaging.\n[x] Integrate developement extensions redux, devtron.\n[x] Add Compodoc.\n[x] Native Module Support.\n[x] Add contribution guidelines.\n[ ] Add Conventional Changelog.\n[ ] Wiki for adding @angular/material.\n[ ] Wiki for adding Bootstrap.\n[ ] Wiki for local FontAwesome for packaging.\n\nangular/cli\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.6.3.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017 AngularClass LLC, Colin Skow\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
